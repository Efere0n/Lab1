Balance (also known as Combination or Combo in Hasbro plastics releases) is a type that finds a "balance" between more than one type. 
Some are a balance of two types which could benefit a Beyblade's performance, such as a combination of Defense and Attack or Stamina and Defense, but most Beys classified as Balance Types are a mix of all three types.
There is at least one major flaw with Balance Types, however. This is that since this class of Beyblade tends to be fairly well-rounded in every category, they don't have any particular strong suit to counter any other particular type of bey. 
Because of this, Stamina-types are generally the best bet against Balance-types, since the latter tends not to be aggressive attackers that will upset a Stamina-type's stability.
Death and Hades are generally the best Balance Fusion Wheels, due to their inherent decent defense and smash attack. 
Metal Face Bolts of any kind can be helpful, like any other combo. Balance-types generally use mid-height Spin Tracks, such as 125-145 heights, but other heights can be useful in certain combos. 
Performance Tips like CS and WD are good for use on most all Balance-type combos, but with these beys a wide variety of tips can be used, so long as they have sufficient stability and Stamina.
