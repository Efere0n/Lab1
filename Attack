Attack is one of three main types of Beyblades. 
Attack Type Beys are known for their quick speed and hard-hitting attacks, as well as having a rather poor Stamina. 
In every Beyblade series (except Beyblade Burst Turbo and Beyblade Burst Surge), the main protagonists, Tyson Granger, Gingka Hagane, Zyro Kurogane, Valt Aoi, Dante Koryu, Hyuga Hizashi and Bel Daizora along with the former antagonists Ryuga, Sakyo Kurayami, and Arthur Peregrine are widely known for using Attack Types. 
Other characters who use Attack Types include Daichi Sumeragi, Masamune Kadoya, Robert JÃ¼rgens, Garland Siebald, Daigo Kurogami, Lui Shirosagi, Xander Shakadera, Xavier Bogard, and Laban Vanot.
The goal for Attack Types are to defeat the opposing Beyblade by either depleting all of its Stamina or by forcing a knockout (KO), sending the opponent flying out of the stadium. 
They must accomplish this in a very short amount of time, since Attack Types heavily rely on makery-fast Blade Bases (Plastics), Running Cores (HMS), or Performance Tips (MFB) with little stamina. 
Attack Types also tend to use Attack Rings (Plastics and HMS) or Fusion Wheels (MFB) designed with spikes and protrusions throughout for a violent appearance in order to deal the most damage to the opponent.
Due to this, Attack Types generally dominate Stamina-types because despite their inherent impressive Stamina, the latter is usually very lightweight and thus easy to KO. 
Though Attack is one of the three main types in the metagame, they are not usually seen in tournaments as often as Defense and Stamina-types.
