Defense is a type of Beyblade that focuses on not being knocked out of the stadium, and finds a chance to cast a deadly counter-attack. Specifically built to counter Attack-types, Defense-oriented Beyblades tend to have only moderate Stamina, but are built to be able to deflect or tank attacks without losing much spin power.
Defense Types need a lot of weight so that they can counter-attacks. Adding a Metal Face Bolt, a Metal God Chip or a Metal Chip Core helps by adding some extra weight. Any Metal Fight Defense-type Beyblade can be improved by using a heavy Energy Ring like Kerbecs, Bull, Jupiter, Cygnus or Aquario. Good Defense wheels are almost always heavy and round, and they include but are not limited to: Twisted (Basalt), Diablo, Duo, Earth and Libra (Pre-HWS wheel).
Defense-type combos like MF-H Twisted (Basalt) Bull TH170CS use high Spin Tracks not only to smash down on their opponents, but also to protect their own Fusion Wheel from lower beys. Other good Spin Tracks for defense include 230, GB145, TR145, C145 and BD145. Defense tips have high friction and/or a hemispherical shape, but mostly the former. 
Recommended Defense tips are: WD, CS, RDF, RB, RS, RSF, and MB.
Defense Beyblades using the aforementioned parts can, for the most part, counter Attack-types, though the former is not invulnerable. Defense-types usually only have only moderate Stamina, allowing Stamina-types to beat Defense-types often in sleep-outs. 
It's worth noting that many Defense-types have enough Attack to knock Stamina types around though, so they can occasionally defeat Stamina-types, though unlikely. Overall, building Defense-type Beyblades is not easy, because perhaps more than any other type, every part counts.
